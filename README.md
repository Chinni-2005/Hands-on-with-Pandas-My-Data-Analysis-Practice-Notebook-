# 🐼 Pandas Practice and Data Analysis  

## 📘 Overview  
This project demonstrates hands-on practice with **Pandas**, focusing on key operations for **data cleaning, manipulation, aggregation, and visualization**.  
It serves as a solid foundation for anyone learning **data analysis using Python**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Understand how to create and manipulate **Series** and **DataFrames**  
- Explore and clean real-world-like datasets  
- Perform **filtering, grouping, and transformation** operations  
- Visualize summarized data using **Matplotlib**  

---

## 🧩 Dataset  
**File:** `housing_sample_2000_v2.csv`  
- Contains **2000 synthetic housing records**  
- Fields include: `date`, `price`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `sqft_living`, `city`, and more  
- The dataset simulates a real-world housing dataset for learning and analysis  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas` → Data manipulation and analysis  
  - `matplotlib` → Data visualization  
  - `numpy` → Numerical computations  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Example Output  
### Average House Price by City
A sample visualization generated using Matplotlib:  
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
plt.bar(city_avg['city'], city_avg['price'])
plt.title('Average House Price by City')
plt.xlabel('City')
plt.ylabel('Average Price')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
